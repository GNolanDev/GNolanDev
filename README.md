- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @GNolanDev (Gareth!)
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in full stack web development and mobile technologies, particularly relating to science education. I am interested in lots of different areas though relating to my past/present interests: military aviation, teaching, outdoor activities etc.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently working as a full-stack web developer, alongside continuing to work on my own projects - php/MySQL/html5/css3/js. See www.timerthing.com and https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.gingerphysics.sailorsmate for a couple of little examples, and my portfolio site at https://gnolan.online.
